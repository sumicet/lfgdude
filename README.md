Connect with Discord. Find a squad. Play together.


### Motivation


There are thousands of LFG (look for group) discord servers, but none of them provide a nice search option or advanced control over your group. LFG Dude aims to solve these issues.



### Features


- Create a lobby, edit your lobby settings
- Search for a lobby
- Filter your search by lobby title, game, hashtags (mic-required, mic-preferref, no-mic, chill, competitive, etc.), and slots.
- Easily share your in-game lobby code for games like Among Us, Phasmophobia, etc.
- Connect with Discord
- Invite your friends
- Add friend (will add them on discord) & kick option (will kick them from your group)
- Each lobby is assigned a voice channel on discord
- Lobbies (and their assigned VCs) are deleted when everyone leaves
- Notifications
